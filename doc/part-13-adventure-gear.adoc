So now we have a dungeon full of monsters and scrolls, but it's still
somewhat lacking in variety. Where are all the swords, shields, staves
and so on?

We need equipment. It differs from the items we have in two ways: you
can only equip it in limited slots and it enhances your abilities
while it's being worn. Unlike our items which are one-use-only (though
they don't have to be!).
